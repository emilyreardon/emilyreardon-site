# Emily Reardon — Design for Civic Futures

This portfolio documents my work at the intersection of education, public systems, and technology.

I design research-driven, humanist systems that advance agency, belonging, and democratic life. My practice bridges public media, higher education, creative technology, and civic infrastructure.

Rather than organizing work by institution, this site traces the through-lines:

- Love as a design framework  
- Education as democracy  
- Play as infrastructure  
- Open systems for public life  
- Art and technology as tools for collective agency  

## What You'll Find

Case studies, prototypes, courses, publications, and experimental builds — spanning public media, universities, and independent research.

This site surfaces the connective tissue across that work.

## Built With

HTML and CSS  
Version-controlled with Git  
Hosted via GitHub Pages  

Intentionally simple. Structured for durability, legibility, and participation — committed to open web infrastructure.

## Get in Touch

I collaborate across academia, nonprofits, public institutions, and mission-driven technology.
